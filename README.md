### Topic Modelling for short noisy documents

I'm use a problem of message relevance identification on 2ch as a case of this study. However, there are much more applied cases such as terrorism identification, medical documents clusterization, marketing analysis and so on.

Basically, I'm using two approaches: unsupervised ML (clusterization) and supervised ML (binary classfication).

Stay tuned, this repo updates every day.
